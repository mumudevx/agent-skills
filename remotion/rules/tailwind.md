You can and should use TailwindCSS in Remotion, if TailwindCSS is installed in the project.

Don't use `transition-*` or `animate-*` classes - always animate using the `useCurrentFrame()` hook.

Tailwind must be installed and enabled first in a Remotion project - fetch https://www.remotion.dev/docs/tailwind using WebFetch for instructions.

For React Native projects using NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native), see the dedicated NativeWind rules in `rules/nativewind/` for setup, className patterns, theming, and common mistakes.
